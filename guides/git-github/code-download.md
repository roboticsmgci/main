# Downloading Code from GitHub

1. In the selected repository, click the Code dropdown, and copy the HTTPS URL
2. In the folder, you want to create a subfolder with the repository, open command prompt and run `git clone URL_FROM_STEP_1`
    - On Windows, you can open command prompt by clicking the file path bar (left of search), typing `cmd`, and pressing Enter
    - Git creates a subdirectory like the following:
      ```
      └───Documents [git clone https://github.com/roboticsmgci/main.git]
          └───main
              ├───guides
              ├───.gitignore
              └───README.md
      ```
