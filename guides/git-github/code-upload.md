# Uploading Code to GitHub

Uploading is more formally called *pushing*. 

1. Open command prompt in the folder
2. Run `git add .`
3. Run `git commit -m "MESSAGE"`
    - Make sure you have an informative message
4. Run `git push`

This part is a simplified tutorial. There are many more commands and components you should know. Please research and experiment the following:
 - `.gitignore` file
 - Branching and forking
 - Pull requests and GitHub issues
 - Merging and merge conflicts
 - Using Git and GitHub in your preferred IDE
